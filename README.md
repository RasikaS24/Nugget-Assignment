# Nugget-Assignment
 Retrieval-Augmented Chatbot trained on data from 5 restaurants

Run in Google Colab

This project works great in Colab.

Open all the 5 files i.e. (MainlandChina.ipynb, Paakashal.ipynb, TheRameshwaramCafe.ipynb, Punjab_Grill.ipynb, Just_blr.ipynb) in GoogleColab to get csv files for each restaurants. For ex.(punjab_grill_normalized.csv, and similar for other 4 websites)

Open Chatbot_clean.ipynb in Colab

Upload the normalized CSVs (5 files). Run all cells â€” chatbot will launch inside the notebook, also you will get a link that works on both mobile phones and laptops.

OR you can just upload the normalized_restaurant_data.csv ( In this case run Chatbot_clean.ipynb from second cell).


NOTE: Every time you run a Gradio app (especially in Colab, Jupyter, or a script), it generates a new public link.
